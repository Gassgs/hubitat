# Weewx Local Capabilities

Please see the [Hubitat Community](https://community.hubitat.com/t/release-weewx-local-capabilities/17709) for more info. You need [this driver](https://github.com/bdwilson/hubitat-weewx-driver) in order to generate the Json data for this app. 


# Notes:

Load up you.weewx.url/daily.json and make sure you get the right variables for
your installation. I am using the ones in the screenshot
[here](https://community.hubitat.com/t/release-weewx-local-capabilities/17709),
but the info you want could vary depending on which devices you have.

This also turns on/off a switch (whatever this device is called) based on the
rain criteria - on for wet/off for dry..  You can use this for
Irrigation apps like Simple Irrigation.
