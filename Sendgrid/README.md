# Sendgrid Email Notification Driver for Hubitat
This is a very basic Sendgrid driver to send email from Hubitat. It requires a
valid Sendgrid account (free account is limited to 100 emails/mo). You also
have to validate ownership of an email (to send as). This isn't ideal unless
you own your own domain, but it will work with free services like
Gmail/Outlook, however delivery is not guarenteed.

# Installation
